# HAGDB Development Staging Branch

## About

Thsi is a staging development branch for Home Assistant Google Drive Backup.  If you are a normal user trying to backup your Home Assistant 
snapshots to Google Drive please leave here and install the addon at [this repository](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup).
This repository is intended for use by developers, and as such is likely to contain unverified code.  The dev branch is pushed here on every checkin, and as such it often has code that might not be ready for a wide release.  This can mean that:

- It might stop working randomly when a new version is pushed automatically
- It might delete all of your snapshots.
- It might corrupt your Home Assistant installation.
